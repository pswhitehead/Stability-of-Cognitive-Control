# Stability-of-Cognitive-Control

## Main takeaway point:
  Engagement of cognitive control fluxtuates not just between individuals (Botella et al., 2019), 
  but also over the course of a task. The variability in control engagement can be reduced by 
  bottom up task contingencies.

## Data used:
  *data from Whitehead, Brewer, Blais, 2018 (JEP:LMC)
  *data collected by Blais (2018)
  
## Ideas for modeling cognitive control engagement over time:
  *use/adapt method from Botella et al., (2019; Acta Psychologica)?
  *develop linear mixed model?
    *would need to use STAN because of size of data
    *frequentist vs. bayesian?
