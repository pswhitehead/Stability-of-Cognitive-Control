The variability in control engagement can be reduced by \n  bottom up task contingencies.\n\n## Data used:\n  *data from Whitehead, Brewer, Blais, 2018 (JEP:LMC)\n  *data collected by Blais (2018)\n  \n## Ideas for modeling cognitive control engagement over time:\n  *use/adapt method from Botella et al., (2019; Acta Psychologica)?\n  *develop linear mixed model?\n    *would need to use STAN because of size of data\n    *frequentist vs. bayesian?",
